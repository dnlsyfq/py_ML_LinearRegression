Lines to fit data . 
Line is a rough approximation
but it allows us the ability to explain and predict variables that have a linear relationship with each other.

* m : The slope is a measure of how steep the line is, while the intercept is a measure of where the line hits the y-axis.
* b : The intercept is a measure of where the line hits the y-axis.
* The goal is to get the “best” m and b for our data.
